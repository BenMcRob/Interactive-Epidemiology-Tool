The bubonic plague goes down as the most deadly pandemics to have ever touched the human species. From the short time
between 1347 to 1351 it ravaged the people of Europe, Africa, and Asia. By the end, it has been estimated that roughly 
three out of every five Europeans had been killed, with equal devastation in other areas. The disease spread through 
infected fleas that had picked it up off the backs of rats. These rats would stowaway on ships and wagons that would 
travel trade roots like the silk road and many others. The fleas would pick up the disease from the rats and would 
transfer it to humans via bites.

The asymptomatic period between infection and the first show of symptoms would often last only two to six days; however,
that was more than enough time to unknowingly spread the disease to many others due to the often close living quarters 
and crowded urban areas of the time. 

The onset of the disease was sudden and intense. Symptoms would include fever and muscle aches along with a painful 
swelling of lymph nodes (typically called buboes, where the bubonic plague gets its name). The mortality rate of those 
infected could often reach as high as 80%. The fast spread of the disease and high mortality rate created an atmosphere 
of panic and fear virtually dismantling the already tenuous social fabric of the dark ages.   

The most important development in combating the bubonic plague was the advancement of sanitary standards. The disease 
ran rampant because people quite literally threw their feces into the streets outside their homes. This lead to ran 
infestations and fleas that spread the disease followed suite. Another breakthrough for combating the bubonic plague 
was the development of the antibiotic in 1928. A medicine that is able to prevent bacteria from reproducing. This 
is widely regarded as the most important break through in modern medicine.
