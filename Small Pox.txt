Smallpox, caused by the variola virus, was endemic for thousands of years. The disease is spread via respiratory droplets,
and it is highly contagious with an R_0 ranging from three to six. Some of the worst smallpox outbreaks occurred when the 
disease was exposed to populations that had not had a chance to build up a natural immunity to it. Most famously brought 
to the Americas by European settlers, smallpox eradicated a large percentage of the native american population. Estimated 
to have killed as many as 90% in some areas, many tribes were entirely wiped out. Smallpox also is especially susceptible 
to young children often with a mortality rate as high as 80%. It has been estimated to have killed between 300 and 500 
million people over its three thousand years. 

When infected with the disease, its incubation period can last from 7 to 17 days making it much easier to spread before 
symptoms show. Initial symptoms are consistent with the common flu; however, after a few days, a characteristic rash 
consisting of pustules will begin to cover the skin. These will eventually scab over and leave heavy scarring (these 
scars provided the first evidence of smallpox when they were discovered on ancient mummies in Egypt). Those that survive 
will often have long term complications that can include respiratory problems and even blindness.

Through extensive efforts to catch outbreaks early as well as widespread vaccination campaigns the World Health 
Organization was able to officially eradicate the disease in 1977 when the last natural case was recorded in Somalia. 
Today, regular smallpox vaccinations are not required, making it the first fully eradicated disease in history.
