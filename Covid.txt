Like many viruses, covid spreads through respiratory droplets that are produced when an infected person talks or breathes.
It spreads fast thanks to a relatively high R_0 between two and three (on average one infected person will infect 2 to 3 
others). This value can be greatly reduced via quarantine thanks to Covid's moderate incubation period between 4 and 5 days.

Seemingly originating from a busy seafood market in Wuhan ChinaIn, an unusual concentration of pneumonia cases was first 
noticed by health officials in December of 2019. By January of 2020, experts had identified the cause as a new coronavirus 
that had likely jumped from one of the animals kept at the market to an unlucky patient zero. Chinese officials acted quickly
to lock down the area, but by then it was far too late. In part thanks to heavy holiday traffic, Covid spread rapidly before
epidemiologists truly understood how infectious it was, and by April of 2020, Covid had spread to most corners of the world. 

Early responses to decrease the spread of infection like social distancing, consistent testing, and lockdown helped
tremendously to "flatten the curve". (a term referring to the importance of minimizing the number of people infected
at any one time in order to not overwhelm the healthcare system) though the degree to how seriously different nations
took the precautions had a great impact on the total total percentage infected, and ultimately the death toll. 

The rapid development of a vaccine also assisted in quelling the spread of the disease. Though vaccines don't completely
eliminate your chances of contracting covid, they can considerably reduce your chances of having a severe reaction as
well as decrease the likelihood you will infect others. This is because antibodies that fight the virus will decrease
the "viral load" (a term referring to the amount of virus that you shed to the environment).
