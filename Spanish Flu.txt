In the short period between Spring of 1918 and 1919, a particularly dangerous strain of H1N1 would ravage the global 
population. Leaving roughly 60 million dead by the end, the Spanish flu would go down as one of the most devastating 
pandemics in modern history. Despite a relatively low R_0 between 1.4 and 2.8, the Spanish Flu spread rapidly across 
the globe thanks to the intense conditions of WWI. Large populations of soldiers and immigrants were constantly 
moving between countries and continents spreading the disease. These groups were often living in areas with poor 
sanitation and high population density. 

The pandemic would come in three distinct waves spread out over the year that it was present. The first wave was 
relatively mild. Many would recover, only experiencing mild symptoms. It is widely believed that the second wave, 
by far the most deadly, was caused by a mutation of the virus that would make it both more dangerous and more 
easily transmissible. The final wave was not as intense as many had developed an immunity to the virus. 

The symptoms of the Spanish Flu are often just more extreme symptoms of the typical flu we are used to; however, 
they would often become so extreme, the patients would begin to turn blue due to lack of oxygen. Pneumonia (a 
condition where the air sacs of a patient's lungs become inflamed by infectious agents) could kill a patient 
within a few days. One unusual aspect of the Spanish Flu was its high impact on young healthy adults. It's been 
theorized that their strong immune response would often do more harm than good, leading to inflammatory reactions.
