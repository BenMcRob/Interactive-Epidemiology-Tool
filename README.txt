* Things to Know *

If the disease selected is Black Death or Spanish Flu, the vaccine and quarantine options will be unavailable to make it more realistic.
This is also the case for Smallpox, but there will still be the option for a vaccine just not quarantining. 

Mutation cuts the timeframe chosen for the epidemic to run in half and in the second half simulates a mutation of the disease. From the
midpoint of the timeframe the disease will restore the Susceptible population with all living Recovered and remove any protection
from vaccination.

The program is best accompanied by playing the album "Himiko Kikuchi - Flying Beagle (1987)" in the background. Easily found on youtube.
