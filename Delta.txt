The Delta variant first showed up in India in October of 2020. The variants of coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) deemed worthy
of concern are named for Greek letters. The proper categorical name for Delta is B.1.617.2.

Variants are just another way of saying that they are a mutation of a disease. Delta's mutation is due at least 13 
different changes in its genetic structure compared to the base coronavirus virus. These genetic changes create proteins
with slightly altered shapes, which affects their function. For Delta, the protein that was most drastically changed was
the spike protein. The spike protein is the largest structural protein for the coronavirus and is where the virus
gets its name from. The spike protein in the coronavirus allows the virus to penetrate cells and fuse their membranes
together. Effectively the spike protein is responsible for the virulency of the coronavirus, and the Delta variant's
mutations to this protein make it more infectious and deadly.

Aside from this, the Delta virus is nearly identical to any other member of the coronavirus family. Its virulency
meant that it dominated the other variants and caused them to go extinct. These variants include Alpha, Beta, 
and Gamma. Though it appears, at time of writing, that Delta itself has gone extinct due to the Omicron variant.
